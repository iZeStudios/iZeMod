# iZeMod 5.0

Minecraft Fabric utility mod designed to improve your gameplay.

## History
iZeMod was originally created in 2013–2014 by iZePlayz and Garkolym as a private utility mod and remained private for
more than a decade. It quickly gained attention through their YouTube channels, especially Garkolym’s, but despite
several announcements, it was never publicly released.

This repository is a full rewrite of the final private iZeMod build (version 4.0.0 for Minecraft 1.8.8/1.12.2), updated
for the latest versions of Minecraft and rebuilt on a modern codebase.

For more information, see the [announcement trailer](https://youtu.be/jli5bhJmCdc).
