# iZeMod 5.0

iZeMod 5.0 is in its very early development stage. No features have been implemented yet, as EnZaXD and I are currently
working on porting the design/theme from iZeMod 4.0 to iZeMod 5.0. Contributions on GitHub are greatly appreciated.
Please feel free to submit a pull request, open an issue, or start a discussion on GitHub.
